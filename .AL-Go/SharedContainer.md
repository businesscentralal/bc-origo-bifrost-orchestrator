# Sequential Default and Test builds

CI/CD and pull request builds create one COSMO Alpaca Default container per project.
`_BuildSharedALGoProject.yaml` runs Default before Test, in separate runner sessions.
Test must reuse the physical container ID returned by Default.

Default retains its release artifact, signing settings and previous-release upgrade checks.
Test recompiles **Bifrost Orchestrator** (`7da3f512-5c19-47cd-bbe4-4c2bc713f1db`) with the internals grant for
its test extension (`194ecd04-5688-4af6-94bc-732c714251fc`), republishes that compiled app before the test
extension, and skips previous-release upgrade deployment. Dependency app IDs and versions
remain unchanged. Final cleanup runs after both phases, including failure and cancellation.

Run `./tools/Test-SharedAlpacaContainer.ps1` to check build-plan validation, mode and
container identity, republish ordering, missing-grant rejection and Default publishing.
The workflows run this check before building. Changes to the helper scripts trigger a full build.
If the container was removed, rerun all jobs rather than the Test phase alone.

AL-Go system updates may overwrite the custom workflow and initialization hooks. Preserve
the sequential wrapper, Default-only container creation plan, deferred cleanup, physical
container check, compiled test grant check and the existing internals-stripping hooks.
The helper validates the pinned Alpaca initialization before changing container selection;
incompatible upstream changes fail instead of silently selecting a different container.
